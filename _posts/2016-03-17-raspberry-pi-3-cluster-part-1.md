The new version of RaspberryPi has just came out with loads of improved features, such as 1.2GHz quad-core processor, wireless LAN and bluetooth connections. You can create a RaspberryPI cluster without horrible cables. And the price is the same. This is the big thing.

So I decided to play around this tiny machines and building a 3 nodes Cassandra cluster with a 1 node Spark lead just to keep the database cluster busy with some open data source. I'm using a switch to connect nodes, not because it's necessary, just because it looks cool, like a real server :-)
